# Adapting the workflow

For a real organization, start by copying `customer-pack-template/` into a
private location and filling in the policy and broker contracts there. Keep this
public repository limited to reusable controller code, synthetic fixtures, and
generic documentation.

## Start with a new synthetic scenario

1. Add a minimal buggy repository under `fixtures/repositories/<scenario>/`.
2. Add visible tests inside that repository.
3. Add a normalized incident and evidence packet under `fixtures/`.
4. Add a required controller-owned verifier under `verifiers/`. The included
   `candidate_probe.py` never imports candidate modules: it evaluates a tiny
   one-function/one-return AST subset. Replace it with a separately
   threat-modeled verifier rather than broadening it to execute arbitrary code;
   keep assertions and the completion marker controller-owned.
5. Add reviewed fixture patches for deterministic success and failure paths.
6. Register the scenario in `fixtures/scenarios.json`.
7. Run it without a model before enabling the Deep Agents provider.

Keep customer names, real identifiers, internal endpoints, credentials, and retained model sessions out of examples.

## Change trusted policy

Edit `config/workflow.json` to select the fixture repository contract, allowed service and environment, path prefixes, evidence caps, required test, pinned Deep Agents SDK/worker/tool contract, and hard limits.

Policy is trusted operator input. Do not derive these values from incident text or model output.

After editing policy, inspect the effective operator surface:

```bash
./scripts/run-local.sh dump-policy
```

Review the output before running a model. It is the compact product-facing view
of what the controller will allow: repository, service, environment, paths,
evidence caps, required test, Deep Agents SDK/worker/tool contract, limits, delivery authority, and
safety-mode pattern.

For a customer pack, keep the public `config/workflow.json` as an example and
store the real policy in the private pack. Do not publish repository names,
internal evidence sources, channels, reviewers, or provider decisions unless the
owner has explicitly approved publication.

## Add another language

Replace the fixture repository and test command, then update the digest-pinned candidate-test image only if verification needs another runtime. Keep the same read-only inputs, controlled temporary storage, no network, no credential forwarding, and controller-derived patch policy.

Add policy tests for language-specific links, generated files, lockfiles, binary output, and test-command handling.

## Add an evidence broker

A broker should accept a normalized query contract and return only bounded, redacted data. It should enforce:

- fixed data source and operation;
- label, table, view, or query allowlists;
- row, byte, and time limits;
- read-only credentials that the model never receives;
- tenant and incident scoping;
- deterministic redaction and audit metadata.

Do not let free-form model text become a database query, log query, shell command, or cloud API request.

Implement each broker as a deterministic pipeline:

```text
request -> validate -> authorize -> execute -> redact -> record -> verify
```

The model should receive the redacted broker result, not the credential, raw
query surface, or live client.

## Add a delivery adapter

Accept only a verified run ID, exact patch digest, candidate digest, target repository, and approved metadata. Expose only the minimum draft operation required.

Keep merge, approval, deployment, protected-branch bypass, incident mutation, and production writes out of the model-facing interface.

The public workflow should keep file-based draft mocks. Live delivery adapters
belong in customer packs until their permissions, branch protection, retry
behavior, and message redaction have been reviewed.

## Real-model qualification

Use the exact supported Deep Agents SDK in the repository-local runtime and an approved provider. Run repeated synthetic scenarios, including failed first attempts, malformed worker output, provider timeout, cleanup failure, and patch-policy denial.

Do not make a credentialed model run a required public CI job. Keep it an explicit manual qualification step.
